#ATGCPROFILER
# 🧬 ATGCProfiler

**ATGCProfiler** is a simple and powerful bioinformatics tool that lets researchers analyze the base composition (A, T, G, C percentages) of any organism’s DNA sequences fetched directly from the NCBI nucleotide database.

Whether you're comparing genomes, profiling organisms, or preparing publication-quality summaries, this tool gets you clean results in seconds.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔎 Fetch nucleotide sequences from NCBI using the organism name
- 📊 Calculate A, T, G, and C base percentages
- 📏 Report sequence lengths and accession IDs
- 📈 Optional: Visualize base composition as bar plots
- 📁 Optional: Export results as downloadable CSV for further analysis (e.g. in Excel or Tableau)

## 📥 Example Output

#Sequence 1 - JBNVUB010000001.1:
Length: 2214268 bp
A: 32.97% T: 32.78% G: 17.16% C: 17.10%

## 🧑‍🔬 Use Case

*“As a researcher, I want to quickly compare ATGC composition across multiple sequences of **Escherichia coli** or any other organism. This tool makes it fast, reliable, and reproducible.”*
